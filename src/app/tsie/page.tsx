        <p className="text-lg mb-2">
          Ethiopian spices like cardamom, turmeric, ginger, berbere, and
          mitmita, known for their bold flavors, are gaining popularity in
          international culinary markets. Below is a summary and a bit more
          information on each spice:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Cardamom (Korarima):</strong> Ethiopian cardamom, or
            Korarima, is significantly larger than black or green cardamom
            varieties. It has a more potent flavor and aromatic quality, making
            it distinct in both scent and taste compared to its smaller
            relatives. Often used in traditional Ethiopian dishes, it enhances
            the overall flavor and adds complexity to culinary creations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Turmeric:</strong> Known for its vibrant deep yellow color,
            turmeric is a notable spice in Ethiopian cuisine. It offers a warm,
            earthy flavor that can enrich stews and other dishes. Care must be
            taken when using turmeric, as its strong taste can dominate if used
            excessively. Commonly used in dishes such as “butecha” and “azifa,”
            which are typically served cold, showcasing turmeric's versatility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Saffron:</strong> Premium-grade saffron cultivation and
            processing, known for its distinct flavor, vibrant color, and
            numerous health benefits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ginger:</strong> Fresh ginger is a staple ingredient in many
            Ethiopian recipes, often used alongside garlic and onions. It adds a
            spicy, zesty kick to dishes, balancing the richness of other
            ingredients. Fresh ginger is crucial for flavoring stews and sauces,
            and Ethiopian ginger is exported in response to demand for its
            freshness and quality.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-lg mb-2">
          These spices not only enhance the flavor profiles of various dishes
          but also represent the rich culinary heritage of Ethiopia.
