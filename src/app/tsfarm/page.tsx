        <p className="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-700">
          The success of any productive farm in part depends on the efficiency
          and effectiveness of the organizational structure developed to guide,
          plan, and manage the human, material, and financial resources deployed
          to achieve the objectives of the farm. Accordingly, the farm has also
          designed an organizational structure taking into account the size of
          the farm and labor force, volume of production, and financial
          transactions that the undertaking entails. The organizational
          structure and its manpower requirements will be fully operational when
          the farm reaches its optimum size. At the top of the organizational
          structure, there is a top management (company owner) to whom the
          general manager is accountable and the next general manager with the
          responsibility of supervising the overall activities of the farm.
          There is an auxiliary division under the general manager. Employees
          under each division are supervised by the division head who is
          accountable to the general manager. The organizational structure of
          the farm is shown in the figure below.
